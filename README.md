# Housing History project.

This project is intended to show current and historic information about different properties, such as historic names, ownership, and prices.

It serves to inform prospective residents about different properties, as well as document changes to different properties over time.

Corroborating information should be publicly sourced, such as what you would find off of the property's website.

This repository may eventually be a starting point for cloning to develop websites for different places.
