## (pages) directory.

Each owner and property will have their own page, and the data for the pages could be stored in different ways.

* Data saved in a relevant .csv file could be information like address or when it started using its current operating name.

	- Ideally, a SQL database would be the primary way to do operations with this data, but .csv files could still be used for initially populating the database or as output of database tables.

* Data saved in a relevant .json file could be the same as in a .csv file, only in .json as an alternative format that may be preferable to work with.

	- A document database could be used for storing and doing operations with .json data instead.

* Data saved in a relevant .warc file could be captures of a web page to corroborate information.
